# Project Vivy Front-end
Just another app for me ðŸ¤­

Learn sveltekit + typescripts when building this project is kinda challenging

I also use TailwindCSS + [SvelteMaterialUI](https://sveltematerialui.com/) and I don't know why it works LoL

Current UI progress :
- [x] Basic Landing Page
- [ ] Login form
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] FAQ & How To (if I make this for public)

## Basic Landing Page

## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
